- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpottedGlass
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis and Web Dev. I also love to go hiking, kayaking and bascially anything to do with the outdoors!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3, Golang, SQL and plan to start dabbling in front end languages like HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything around Web Dev. 
- 📫 How to reach me: sp0tt3dglass@gmail.com
